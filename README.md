Needs to be done:

To do
================================================================================
- Pagination

- Ajax for response
- Featured side bar functionality

Modules (Which we could use)
================================================================================

- User: https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser
- OAuth: https://github.com/SocalNick/ScnSocialAuth
- ACL: https://github.com/bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize

Few guidelines
================================================================================
- Signed links for share -> CloudFront service (way faster!) -> CNAME record on host server for prettier URL!
- Pagination, not scroll to infinity -> Easy ad distribution and less unique ads needed!
