To do
================================================================================
- Pagination
- Input filters for upload
- Input filters for external resource
- Entity, hydrator and mapper for response
- Ajax for response
- Featured side bar functionality
- Import error design - 404 and others

Modules (Which we could use)
================================================================================
- AWS: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php-zf2
- User: https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser
- OAuth: https://github.com/SocalNick/ScnSocialAuth
- ACL: https://github.com/bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize

Few guidelines
================================================================================
- Signed links for share -> CloudFront service (way faster!) -> CNAME record on host server for prettier URL!
- Pagination, not scroll to infinity -> Easy ad distribution and less unique ads needed!
